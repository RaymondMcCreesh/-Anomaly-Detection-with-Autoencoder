README for "Anomaly Detection with Autoencoders"
---

Overview:

In this project, I delved into the fascinating realm of autoencoders and their application in anomaly detection. Leveraging a mystery dataset with multiple explanatory variables and a response variable, I embarked on the journey to pinpoint anomalous data points.

Dataset:

The dataset, sourced from data.csv, comprises 9 explanatory variables and one response variable. This response variable is pivotal as it indicates whether a sample is anomalous (1 for anomalous, 0 for valid).

Approach:

1. Data Pre-processing: The journey began with a deep dive into the dataset, focusing on preprocessing techniques tailored for unsupervised learning models.
2. Model Training: Ensuring model convergence was a challenge. My approach balanced the selection of the right parameters and a topology that incorporated 2 encoded variables.
3. Threshold Selection: The crux of anomaly detection lies in determining the right threshold. I based my decision on empirical results combined with a deep understanding of the data distribution.
4. Experimenting with Variational Autoencoders (VAE): To broaden the scope, I also ventured into implementing a VAE and juxtaposed its capabilities against traditional autoencoders.

Key Insights:

- Autoencoders, given their unsupervised nature, provide an intriguing perspective on anomaly detection, especially when the anomaly rate is low.
- The balance between model complexity and overfitting is delicate. Simplifying the architecture can sometimes yield better results.
- Threshold selection for anomalies is more of an art than science, demanding a mix of empirical evidence and domain knowledge.

Technologies and Libraries:

- Python: The core programming language for the project.
- TensorFlow & Keras: Leveraged for building and training the autoencoder models.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizations and insights.

Future Scope:

- Exploring other unsupervised and semi-supervised learning techniques for anomaly detection.
- Implementing a real-time anomaly detection system using the trained model.

Closing Thoughts:

This project was not just an exploration of autoencoders but also a deep dive into the nuances of anomaly detection. The insights gleaned from this experience have further fueled my passion for AI and Machine Learning.
